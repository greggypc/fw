Our vision is to facilitate thoughtful dialog about space, function and individuality. We work to create spaces that are experienced not just physically or visually, but emotionally and intuitively. Through the design process we encourage clients to learn more about themselves and how they interact with the built environment. Our approach is based on communication, patience, sensitivity and respect. We work collaboratively to achieve simple, unique design solutions. We are sensitive to the consequences of our work and give attention to the economic, ecological, social and emotional context of each project.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </AnimatedBox>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
