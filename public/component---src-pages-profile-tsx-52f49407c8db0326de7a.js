Our vision is to facilitate thoughtful dialog about space, function and individuality. We work to create spaces that are experienced not just physically or visually, but emotionally and intuitively. Through the design process we encourage clients to learn more about themselves and how they interact with the built environment. Our approach is based on communication, patience, sensitivity and respect. We work collaboratively to achieve simple, unique design solutions. We are sensitive to the consequences of our work and give attention to the economic, ecological, social and emotional context of each project."),a.a.createElement("p",null,"Beyond meeting individual client needs Faye + Walker strives to participate in a larger conversation about design and art through community involvement.

We work to synthesize aesthetics, needs and desires with quality and utility. We are committed to developing a schematic foundation on which to thoughtfully layer our client’s influences. We invest time with our clients in our initial interactions. This time is spent getting to know their personalities, needs, histories and desires. We believe this time, effort and communication upfront saves us from valuable mistakes or misunderstandings as the project progresses. We use this information to guide clients in decision making and assist clients in realizing their ideal spaces. We use patient and thorough communication as a tool to resolve the challenging or troublesome decisions that come with architectural projects.

We want to make sure we create spaces that fit our clients beyond aesthetic or stylistic preferences, beyond basic function. We hope to tap into the intuitive character of our clients and create spaces for them that contribute to their emotional well-being.
