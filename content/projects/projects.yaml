        We flipped the program of the house, moving the master bedroom to the front of the house and creating new Living, 
        Kitchen and Dining space to the rear of the existing house to capitalize on this new relationship. 
        A covered Terrace further enhances the connectivity to the rear yard for this family of 4. 
        Conceived as a simple trussed rectangle, we ganged the trusses together to make deep, plywood clad beams, 
        the result a coffered ceiling that organizes the high windows south and north which provide ample and dramatic daylight."

  desc: "The Alley House began as a collection of neighbors with a shared vision, spearheaded by our client, 
        to create a series of secondary dwelling units facing an existing alley in central Austin. 
        The overarching idea was to bring a succession of these secondary units, five in a row, with the shared goal of 
        activating the alley and infusing it with life. The current experience was that of 8-foot-tall fences along the alley, 
        segregating any activities between the rear yards and the alley itself. Our client had a vision to break down these visual barriers 
        and foster a secondary level of community engagement in the neighborhood.
        <br /><br />  
        The original format was that of an architectural competition. Our client gathered all of the neighbors and selected 3 
        architecture firms to provide a schematic presentation of ideas for the comprehensive project. Faye + Walker was selected 
        and we set to work on two of the 5 ADUs shortly thereafter. In the end, only two of the projects were initiated, and ultimately, 
        only the Alley House was completed.
        <br /><br />  
        Over time the program shifted a bit. For example, a single car garage that was initially slated to house a kiln for my client's 
        clay studio, it in fact became a single car garage for a vintage Porsche. On the ground floor level, what was going to become 
        an office for a staging company became an office, painting studio and listening room for the client. The upper level, always 
        designed to provide an autonomous living space for rent, remained as originally conceived.
        <br /><br />  
        Now the garage has become an additional living space, and our client now has a pied-a-tere in Austin, 
        having moved pretty much full time to the Pacific Northwest.
        <br /><br />  
        The unusual formal response of the building is a response to development restrictions along the alley, creating a dynamic 
        façade and a prominent steel stair. Generous glazing provides the connection to the alley our client originally desired. 
        The lower level office has a direct connection to the rear yard through a large sliding door. 
        A gap in the building on the lower level provides access from the alley to the other buildings on the property."

  desc: "Scenic House was first an exploration of renovating an existing house. Colonial in nature, the execution of the original 
        construction was not exacting, resulting in particular asymmetries when clearly the interpretation of style should have resulted 
        in perfect symmetry. Due to the client's sensibilities, several attempts to reconcile the existing conditions proved fruitless, 
        until ultimately, we were asked to rethink the entire site as a new home.
        <br /><br />  
        We explored a new proposal re-utilizing the existing foundation as well as one from a completely original starting point. 
        After reviewing both options closely we elected to pursue a new home on a new foundation. 
        This allowed for a heightened relationship to the rear yard, replete with a pool for the Owner, an avid swimmer. 
        The rear yard gently slopes to a grove of existing Live Oak trees, now more visible through the transparency we created 
        along the rear facades of the home.
        <br /><br />  
        The narrative from the Owner revolved around her sensibilities toward timeless architecture. 
        Though she wanted her home to embrace traditional components, she was very much interested in creating some contemporary 
        elements to allow the house to at once be steeped in history and of it's current time. A long span steel beam at the rear 
        covered terrace has a single supporting column, creating uninterrupted sitelines to the rear yard, something only 
        contemporary strategies can accomplish. While the front façade of the house illustrates traditional divided lite 
        casement windows, simple brick and cut stone detailing and timeless forms, the contemporary Walnut entry door hints at a 
        slight departure from tradition. As you move into the living areas of the house, large floor to ceiling sliding glass doors 
        provide a seamless connection to the exterior of the house.
        <br /><br />  
        The Owner was instrumental in the material palette and interior finishing of the project. A fantastic collaborator,

        The window is recessed and surrounded by a cut limestone frame that emulates the exterior structure of a camera lens 
        while functioning as a shading device for the window in the summer months. 
        The form of the structure was based on the owners existing house to the west, conceived as an extrusion of the simple gable form,

  desc: "Perched on a serene, wooded landscape, Tree House is a collaborative endeavor between Faye + Walker and a client with a 
        shared background in architecture, as well as a vision of the expansive land nestled among Live Oak trees. 
        The initial phase of the project, conceived as a temporary retreat, seamlessly evolved into a permanent 
        residence during a second phase of design a few years later, reflecting a thoughtful integration with the natural landscape. 
        <br /><br /> 
        The exterior staircase, inspired by the timber constructions of architect Peter Zumthor for both the Stielneset Memorial and the 
        Allmannajuvet Zinc Mine Museum, anchors the house as a central plinth. Differentiated from the volumes containing the 
        living quarters of the house, the staircase showcases a harmonious blend of structural integrity and aesthetic allure. 
        Around the staircase, three white volumes organize a house for a couple and their grown daughters. 
        While the first phase of the project involved the construction of a full house contained in a single volume, 
        the second phase adapted the residence to family growth, transforming the original volume into a fully equipped 
        guest house to accommodate the owner's grown daughters and their families. Two new volumes contain the couple's 
        sleeping quarters en suite, and a double height living room next to a kitchen on the ground floor, 
        and a studio space on a mezzanine above. This flexibility reflects a design philosophy that caters to evolving familial needs, 
        and enables the possibility of turning the studio space into new guest quarters.
        <br /><br />
        The material palette employed throughout the project demonstrates a careful selection process. Cedar is used on the 
        exterior staircase, complemented by maple cladding and Turkish black marble internally. 
        The transition to the second phase of design offered an opportunity to evaluate the durability of 
        materials employed years earlier in the first phase, and introduced thermally modified pine for the exterior staircase, 
        enhancing both durability and design continuity.
        <br /><br />
        Meticulously integrating with the natural surroundings, the project considers topography for the layout of load bearing 
        walls and openings with views to the expansive landscape. Standing seam metal, locally sourced and fabricated, 
        forms the exterior, while plywood interiors emphasize simplicity and sustainability. 
        The residence's ability to reduce maintenance needs through the use of thermally modified wood further 
        underscores its commitment to enduring design principles. Interior spaces showcase maple cladding, 
        Turkish black marble, and strategically placed windows. This deliberate design prioritizes connections with the 
        natural surroundings, creating a serene living experience that resonates throughout the residence.
        <br /><br />
        The involvement of Faye + Walker was evident through consistent site visits, fostering close collaboration with the contractor. 
        This hands-on approach ensured the alignment of design intent and execution, resulting in a project where meticulous 
        details contribute to the overall design integrity.
        <br /><br />
        The architectural journey of Tree House unfolds as a seamless blend of design evolution, recognition, and functional adaptation. 
        From its roots as a temporary retreat to its current status as a permanent home, 
        this residence stands as a testament to enduring architectural excellence in the heart of the Texas hills.

        designers and artists for the Mollie Steves Zachry Texas Arboretum at the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, Texas. 
        Fortlandia seeks to engage with its visitors by inspiring play while provoking a sense of adventure and imagination, 
        with the ultimate goal of cultivating appreciation for art and nature in children and adults alike.
        <br /><br /> 
        The inspiration for Color Trail originates from the inherent order in nature. 
        Though seemingly organic, wildflowers exhibit an ordered structure, from their precise petal number and pattern to their seemingly organized propagation across grassy fields. 
        This is often the scene of the Texas Hill Country, where clusters of colorful wildflowers are found amid otherwise plain sceneries. 
        Color Trail emulates this idea by having a monochromatic exterior shell that envelops highly contrasting planes that intersect each other. 
        The intersecting planes are dyed blue and red after the Texas bluebonnet and the Texas Indian paintbrush, two of Lady Bird Johnson’s favorite flowers.
        <br /><br />
        Color Trail is composed of two intersecting 42-foot-long planes of color that shift slightly from each other, 
        both sheathed within a six by six foot extruded visually porous box. 
        An armature of 1 1/2” square steel tubes wrapped in 2” wide polyester webbing supports and partially conceals the planes, 
        while giving a glimpse of the colorful interior. 
        The interior planes subtly rise and fall in parallel with the horizon and the surrounding landscape.
        <br /><br />
        We wanted participants to enjoy the mystery of seeing a semi-solid structure nestled into the landscape, 
        and to feel compelled to experience a physical interaction. 
        Participants could enter at either end, experiencing a slight bounce beneath their feet while catching fleeting views through sunlit straps and hearing others making their way through; some visible, some hidden. 
        A series of rhythmic openings in the vertical plane, coupled with an opening in the horizontal plane as another access point to the lowest level, allowed for participants to create their own path. 
        Participants could then climb and make their way to the opposite end or back to the beginning again.

        however they were in need of additional space as their family was expanding
        <br /><br />
        We proposed a rather contemporary addition, designed to recede into the canopy of some existing trees, 
        in an effort to cause the addition to become integrated into the surrounding foliage. 
        The form is a direct proportional copy of the existing gable over the front porch, set slightly back and off center; 
        in essence, the shadow of the existing house if one were to cast a light up at the existing gable from the ground. 
        The deep black stain, contrasted with the existing white bungalow further emphasizes the original structure of the home.
        <br /><br />
        The addition docks into the north portion of the existing house in a way that takes advantage 
        of some additional building area along the north property line that was previously under utilized. 
        To acheive this we placed the new second floor trusses on the plate line of the existing lower floor, 
        then posted down on the north side with a series of steel columns. 
        This connection with the ground further emphasizes the dematerializtion of the addition, the columns like slender tree trunks.
        <br /><br />
        Into the shadow we placed a series of windows where appropriate, some large to take advantage of the proximity to the tree canopy. 
        The window in the Master Bedroom is now affectionately referred to as 'Squirrel TV'.

  desc: "Court Houses are the result of our desire to increase density within the urban core of Austin. 
        Instead of building one single family residence on a city lot, we built two. 
        <br /><br />
        The lot is on a corner, which provided separate points of access. 
        The surrounding neighborhood context is a mixture of residential projects and city and private development infrastructure. 
        This infrastructure, located across each street forming the corner, 
        informed a courtyard design for the houses as a way to mitigate their presence and provide a private refuge.
        <br /><br />
        Formally each house is an L, opposing one another to create a perimeter boundary surrounding an internal courtyard. 
        The courtyard is bisected by a mixed red handmade brick wall as it weaves through the property, 
        providing both physical and visual separation between each house, 
        as well as a contrast to the smooth steel troweled white stucco used to clad the houses.
        <br /><br />
        The first floors are separated, and these opposing separations provide passage into the courtyard and subsequent entry for each house. 
        The second floors are joined above these exterior passages due to zoning restrictions, 
        however distinct separation is achieved through framing and ceiling heights.
        <br /><br />
        The overall massing of the project was conceived as a stark white square box with the middle removed. 
        From this box we began to carve into the mass and create overhangs and perpendicular walls into which we inserted most of the glazing. 
        On the street side of the houses this both provides shade for the glazing and orients views up and down the streets, 
        as opposed to across the street to the surrounding infrastructure. 
        In the courtyard the overhangs provide covered exterior living and dining areas, and extensive glazing was used facing the courtyard to capture daylight, 
        while careful placement maintains privacy between the houses.
        <br /><br />
        There was extensive bamboo on the property prior to construction. 
        We harvested all that was in the footprint of the project and created a series of privacy and shading screens with the bamboo. 
        These provide a delicate contrast to the massive fields of stucco and provide dynamic shadows and shade. 
        Smart building technology was used throughout construction in order to reduce future consumption of energy. 
        The siting, orientation and courtyard design result in low solar heat gain with plenty of daylighting.
